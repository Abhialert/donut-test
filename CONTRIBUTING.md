1. Pull requests can be submitted to any opted-in repository on GitHub or GitLab.
2. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.
3. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
4. If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
5. To get a shirt, you must make four approved pull requests (PRs) on opted-in projects between October 1-31 in any time zone.
6. This year, the first 50,000 participants can earn a T-shirt.

Feel free to do your own code. Our mission is to get clean code (you can pull everything yyou like!)
But of course, please don't just print "Hello world" or anything like that!

I will accept any source code that can run (it's okay if it had some bug, at least it can run).
All bugged code will be fixed by other people, but please mention the bug so it will be more challenging
