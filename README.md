but dont worry, we gonna made it another one ass soon as we finish remake that in python

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now,

Welcome to donut-test, feel free to pull you own code building

feel free to do your own research code that might be helpfull

our mission is to get clean code (you can pull everything you think it usefull!) but of course please not printed some "Hello world".

i wil accpet any source code that than can run (it's okay if it had some bug, at least it can run). 
Everyone could fix the other buged code.
all bugged code could be fixed by anyone people, but pls mention the bug so it will be more challangging

After everything you made made, anything like bug list, code review, new pull request, dont forget to add your name at CONTRIBUTING.md
I will merge it ass soon as someone add new name to contributing list

Thank you all guys, happy coding and feed a bug XD
