Now,

Welcome to donut-test, feel free to pull your own code!

Feel free to do your own code. Our mission is to get clean code (you can pull everything yyou like!)
But of course, please don't just print "Hello world" or anything like that!

I will accept any source code that can run (it's okay if it had some bug, at least it can run).
All bugged code will be fixed by other people, but please mention the bug so it will be more challenging

After you pull anything that you have made (like bug list, code review, new pull request, etc). Don't forget to add your name at CONTRIBUTING.md!
I will merge it as soon as someone adds a new name to contributing list.

Thank you so much, guys! Happy coding and feed a bug XD
